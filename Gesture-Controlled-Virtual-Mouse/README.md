# Gesture-Controlled Virtual Mouse 🎯  

## 🚀 Overview  
This project is a **gesture-controlled virtual mouse**, designed to enable intuitive computer interaction using AI-powered hand tracking. Developed with **passion for AI & ML**, the system replaces traditional inputs with smart gestures, improving accessibility and functionality.  

## ✨ Features  
✅ **Hand Gesture Tracking** – Enables smooth cursor movements.  
✅ **Click & Scroll Actions** – Replicates mouse functions using gestures.  
✅ **AI-Powered Recognition** – Uses **MediaPipe & OpenCV** for real-time tracking.  
✅ **Customizable Sensitivity** – Fine-tune gesture responsiveness for a better experience.  

## 🛠 Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tw1light1/GitHub-Desktop-Repo.git


- Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
- Run the application:
python main.py
🎮 UsageSimply move your hand in front of the webcam, and the AI will track movements to control the cursor!🔧 CustomizationI have integrated adjustable sensitivity and gesture calibration, allowing users to tweak tracking speed and click detection through config.py.🤝 Contributions & My Development NotesThis project has been carefully refined to improve responsiveness and usability. My main areas of focus were:
✅ Optimizing gesture recognition for smoother tracking.
✅ Enhancing click accuracy to prevent false detections.
✅ Refactoring the code for better readability and modular structure.Future Improvements (Planned Additions)I am working on integrating:
🚀 Voice command support alongside gesture recognition.
🚀 Multi-hand tracking to support more advanced gestures.📌 LicenseMIT License – Free to use and modify.
